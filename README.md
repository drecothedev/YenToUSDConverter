YenToUSDConverter ðŸ¦¦

This app is FOR EDUCATAIONAL PURPOSES ONLY!

A lightweight SwiftUI app that converts Japanese Yen (Â¥) to US Dollars ($) in real time.  
This app also allows Euros and GBP to be converted to USD. In future releases we will add support for users to add their own currency choices.

This idea stemmed from my visit to Japan. I didn't want to keep going to google and typing "yen to usd converter", so I created this for me and my family. I wanted to make the app a fun time for users while also keeping very straight forward.
